## Promotion triggers evaluation
Promotions are evaluated against a cart. From this evaluation, promotions can be resolved **to be fired**, or **to be potentially fired**. In this latter case, promotions that fulfill conditions to be triggered only to a certain extent (not completely), but enough to be interesting for a customer to be informed of the possibility of getting the advantages of the promotion if he buys more products to meet all promo conditions. A single product in a cart could be affected by many potentially fired promotions.

Promotions have a certainty factor that represents how close they are to be actually fired, being triggered on certainty == 1. The closer to 1, the closer they are to being fired.

## Promotion priority
Promotions are evaluated in order depending on their priority value. This is important as products can only participate on 1 fired promotion from the set of potential promotions.
